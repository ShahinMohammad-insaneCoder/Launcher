What's new in Launcher v1.4.0?

- You can choose between multiple date formats.
- You can decide if Launcher should show or hide your notification bar.
- You  can choose to immediately launch a search result,
    once there only is one related to your search.
- Try the new experimental feature: two finger swipe gestures.
- Launcher settings just look cleaner now ^^

I hope you enjoy using the app - and don't forget to leave some feedback!
